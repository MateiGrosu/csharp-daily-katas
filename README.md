# 🥋 C# Daily Katas

This repository documents my journey in mastering **C#** and **.NET** through deliberate practice.

The goal of these exercises (Katas) is not just to solve the problem, but to solve it using **Clean Code principles**, **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, and efficient algorithms.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** C# (.NET 8.0)
* **Testing:** xUnit / NUnit
* **Focus:** LINQ, OOP Design Patterns, Refactoring
